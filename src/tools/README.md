# Framework

A minimalist framework to use as view_state for nodable development. The idea is to keep separate the generic functionalities from
the nodable application in order to reuse it for several apps (one day...).

### `./core`

Framework core library including the bare minimum to develop a simple headless application.

### `./gui`

Framework gui including the bare minimum to develop a simple gui application (rely on ImGui, SDL2, and OpenGL).

### `./gui-example`

Minimalist example of an application to demonstrate how to use [framework-gui](./gui).
